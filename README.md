# virtual-mouse-using-python
virtual mouse system can  be  used  to overcome problems in the real world  such  as situations where there is no space to use a physical mouse and also for the persons who have problems in their hands and are not able to control a physical mouse. Also, amidst of the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the  virtual mouse can be used to overcome these problems since hand gesture and hand Tip detection is used to control the PC mouse functions by using a webcam or a built-in camera. 

**SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES used:**

python is a simple language and is platform independent   with a flexibility and is portable which is desirable in  creating a program which is focused in such an aim for  creating a Virtual Mouse and Hand Recognition system.

  Media Pipe
  
  PyAutoGUI
  
  Numpy

**OpenCV **

   A computer vision package called OpenCV contains techniques for processing images that detect objects. Real-time computer vision applications may be made using the Python computer vision package known as OpenCV. The OpenCV library is used to analyze data from  photos  and videos,  including  face  and  object detection.

**Media Pipe**

   A  framework  called Media  Pipe is  a Google  open-source  framework  that  is  applied  in  a  machine learning  pipeline. Since  the  Media Pipe  framework was created utilizing time series data, it may be used for  cross-platform  programming .Analyze systems using  graphs  as  well  as  to  create  systems  for application-related  purposes.

**NumPy(Numerical Python)**

Numpy is a fundamental library for Python numerical computing. It provides efficient multi-dimensional array objects and various mathematical functions for handling large datasets making it a critical tool for professionals in fields that require heavy computation.

**PyAutoGUI**

     In essence, PyAutoGUI is a Python software that runs on Windows, MacOS X, and Linux and allows users to imitate  keyboard button pushes as well as mouse cursor movements and clicks. A Python package for cross-platform  GUI automation  for people  is called PyAutoGUI.
